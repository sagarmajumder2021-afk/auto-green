# 🌱 GitHub Auto Green - Daily Contribution Automation

## 💡 About
This repository automatically creates a **daily commit** to keep your GitHub graph active 💚  
Even if you're offline, it will make sure your profile stays fully green every single day.

---

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### 1️⃣ Create a New Repository
Name it: `auto-green`

Then open the repo → click on **"Add file → Create new file"**

---

### 2️⃣ Create Folder & File Structure
Create this folder structure:
```
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── auto-commit.yml
```

---

### 3️⃣ Paste This Code into `auto-commit.yml`
```yaml
name: Auto Commit - Keep GitHub Green
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 5 * * *'  # Runs every day at 5:00 AM IST
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Update Log File
        run: |
          echo "✅ Daily update - $(date)" >> daily-log.txt

      - name: Commit and Push Changes
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "sagarmajumder2021-afk"
          git config --global user.email "airelatedworkuse@gmail.com"
          git add .
          git commit -m "💚 Auto commit - $(date)"
          git push
```

---

### 4️⃣ Commit the File
* Scroll down → Click **"Commit new file"**

---

### 5️⃣ Enable GitHub Actions
* Go to **Actions tab** → You'll see your new workflow
* Click **"I understand my workflows, enable them"**

---

### 6️⃣ That's it! 🎉
This workflow now runs automatically **every day at 5 AM IST**, adding a small update (and commit) to your repo.

💚 Your contribution graph will start filling up with green boxes daily.

---

## 🧠 Optional Upgrades

If you want to make it smarter:

1. Replace the daily message with:
   ```bash
   echo "Daily log: $(date)" >> log-$(date +'%Y-%m-%d').txt
   ```
   → Creates a new log file each day.

2. Fork 2–3 more repos and add similar automation (for AI, tech, or daily code logs).

3. Pin this repo on your profile — it shows you're active daily ⚡

---

## 🏆 Example Output

Your repo will automatically get commits like:
```
💚 Auto commit - Sun Oct 19 05:00:00 2025
💚 Auto commit - Mon Oct 20 05:00:00 2025
💚 Auto commit - Tue Oct 21 05:00:00 2025
```

And your GitHub contribution chart will look **FULL GREEN 🌿** — 365 days a year!
